<h1>Module 2: Workflow Orchestration with Kestra</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Module 2 introduced me to Kestra, an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform that simplifies building both scheduled and event-driven workflows. It adopts Infrastructure as Code practices for data and process orchestration, enabling the creation of reliable workflows with just a few lines of YAML. Working with Kestra was both challenging and rewarding, as I learned how to orchestrate complex data workflows efficiently.
