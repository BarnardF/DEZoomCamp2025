<h1>Workshop week</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This repository contains my work from the Workshop Week of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. During this week, I focused on working with Data Load Tool (DLT) to streamline data ingestion and transformation.

<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
In this workshop, you’ll learn the core skills required to build and manage data pipelines:


    - How to build robust, scalable, and self-maintaining pipelines.
    - Best practices, like built-in data governance, for ensuring clean and reliable data flows.
    - Incremental loading techniques to refresh data quickly and cost-effectively.
    - How to build a Data Lake with DLT.


By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to build data pipelines like a senior data engineer — quickly, concisely, and with best practices baked in.


<h2>Key Features</h2>

    - Automated Ingestion: Efficiently loading raw data into the pipeline.
    - Data Quality Checks: Ensuring data consistency and integrity.
    - Pipeline Orchestration: Managing workflow execution with DLT.
    - Scalability: Handling large datasets efficiently.

<h2>Software & Tools Used</h2>
