<h1>Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Workshop Week

Overview

This repository contains my work from the Workshop Week of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. During this week, I focused on working with Data Load Tool (DLT) to streamline data ingestion and transformation.

What You Will Learn
In this workshop, you’ll learn the core skills required to build and manage data pipelines:


    How to build robust, scalable, and self-maintaining pipelines.
    Best practices, like built-in data governance, for ensuring clean and reliable data flows.
    Incremental loading techniques to refresh data quickly and cost-effectively.
    How to build a Data Lake with DLT.


By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to build data pipelines like a senior data engineer — quickly, concisely, and with best practices baked in.
